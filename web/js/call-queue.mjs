// lazy import hook fetches driver source, which hands control back to the
// event loop; a second call entering the interpreter at that point re-executes
// the same driver module and CHIRP's registry rejects the duplicate
// registration ("Duplicate radio driver id"). Serializing the calls removes
// the overlap entirely.
