# Release Notes

## 2026-07-23
- Added channel copy, cut, and paste (#7, contributed by lanrat): available from the channel actions menu or via native Ctrl/Cmd+C/X/V. The clipboard format mirrors desktop CHIRP — tab-separated values with the canonical CSV header row — so channels round-trip with Google Sheets/Excel, other webchirp tabs, and desktop CHIRP itself. Selected channels can also be reordered with new Move Up/Down buttons (Alt+ArrowUp/ArrowDown). Two paste correctness fixes landed with it: values pasted into columns the radio marks read-only no longer silently reset to defaults (e.g. TStep on the UV-5R), and numeric enum columns now accept spreadsheet-normalized values ("5" for "5.00", "23" for "023"). New unit suites `scripts/test-clipboard.mjs` and `scripts/test-ui-channel-cut.mjs` run as part of `npm run test:channels`.
- Loading a binary `.img` codeplug now selects the radio make/model automatically from the image's own CHIRP metadata trailer (#15). Previously this failed with `Unsupported model` unless the matching driver happened to be imported already, because the browser runtime imports drivers lazily. The metadata (vendor/model/driver class) is parsed without importing any driver, matched against the static radio catalog (exact class name first, vendor/model fallback for unregistered base classes like `BaofengUV5R` → `BaofengUV5RGeneric`), and the matched driver is imported before CHIRP detection runs. CHIRP's `MODEL_COMPAT` renames are applied; unmatched images are logged to Debug Output.
- CSV and binary codeplug exports are now named `<brand>_<model>_<date>.<format>` instead of a generic filename.
- All tooltips now appear after a consistent 400ms hover delay.
- Added `npm run screenshots` to regenerate the repo screenshots (README, Open Graph, social preview) from the live app.

## 2026-07-22
- Android now offers both connect paths when its native Web Serial is available (arriving for Bluetooth RFCOMM serial ports): "Connect via WebSerial" for Bluetooth serial ports and "Connect via WebUSB" for wired USB adapters, which Android's native Web Serial cannot drive. While connected, the two buttons collapse into a single Disconnect button matching the active transport. Desktop and WebUSB-only browsers keep their single-button behavior, and a serial-log hint explains the split when both paths are offered.
- Added WebUSB serial support for Android Chrome (#8): native chip drivers for FTDI (`web/js/ftdi-webusb.js`, FT231X/FT232R etc.) and Prolific PL2303 (`web/js/pl2303-webusb.js`, with per-generation chip detection from 01/HX/TA/TB through the HXN family), plus a CDC-ACM fallback via Google's lazily-imported `web-serial-polyfill`. A single WebUSB device chooser dispatches the chosen cable to the right driver, which exposes the Web Serial `SerialPort` surface so `BrowserSerialBridge` works identically over both transports. Hardware-verified on Android Chrome with FTDI and PL2303 cables completing real radio clone downloads; CH340/CP2102 are documented as unsupported.
- The UI now shows one connect button per platform: native Web Serial on desktop, WebUSB on Android (where `navigator.serial` exists but cannot drive FTDI/PL2303-class programming cables).
- Fixed a read-path deadlock in the WebUSB drivers: a `ReadableStream` `pull()` that resolved without enqueuing (status-only packet from an idle FTDI chip) was never re-invoked per the Streams spec, wedging all reads. Both drivers now poll inside `pull()` until real payload arrives and recover stalled bulk IN endpoints with `clearHalt`.
- Added `npm run test:serial` — 22 unit tests covering transport selection/fallback, FTDI baud-divisor vectors and init, status-byte stripping, the read-deadlock regression, PL2303 chip detection and init sequences, DTR/RTS transitions, and chooser dispatch.
- The site now deploys to GitHub Pages via a GitHub Actions workflow that builds `dist/` on push to master, with a custom domain (CNAME). Previous-generation hashed assets are retained across deploys so already-open tabs keep working after a release.

## 2026-07-21
- Radio make/model dropdowns now populate instantly from a prebuilt static catalog (`web/radio-catalog.json`) instead of booting Pyodide and importing every CHIRP driver on first load; live driver enumeration remains as a fallback.
- Added a `build:catalog` npm script (run automatically by `build:dist`) that regenerates the catalog from the local CHIRP submodule.
- Added a search box above the make/model dropdowns to filter radios by make or model.
- Fixed a pre-existing crash (`Duplicate radio driver id`) when selecting a radio: concurrent metadata/settings calls could re-execute a driver module while its lazy import was suspended fetching source. All Pyodide-backed runtime calls now run one at a time through a FIFO queue.
- The static radio catalog is only used when it was built from the exact CHIRP revision the runtime is pinned to; otherwise the app falls back to live driver enumeration. The pin is now a single shared constant and `build:catalog` fails on a submodule/pin mismatch.
- Typing in the radio search box no longer triggers a driver load per keystroke; the load is debounced until typing settles, skipped when the selection is unchanged, and stale responses can no longer overwrite a newer selection.
- Added a clone progress bar for radio download/upload (#10): CHIRP drivers' per-block `status_fn` reports are now forwarded through a new `serial_progress` global to a native `<progress>` bar in the Serial Bridge panel, showing the driver's phase message and a percentage (indeterminate when a driver reports no block counts), hidden when idle. Debug logging drops to one line per phase-message change instead of one per block.

## 2026-07-10
- Pinned the repo Node version back to 22.11.0 (from 25.2.1). Node 25 broke the `codex` CLI on startup (circular-dependency module warnings, then it failed to launch) whenever run in this directory. Verified the project still builds and passes checks on Node 22: `build:dist`, `test:channels` (8/8), `serialport` native addon load, and `runtime_bridge.py` compile all pass.

## 2026-07-03
- Added explicit relative favicon links to the app and About pages. Browsers only auto-discover `/favicon.ico` at the domain root, so deployments served from a sub-path (e.g. GitHub Pages project sites) showed no favicon; the explicit `./favicon.ico` reference works at any mount point.

## 2026-06-23
- Mobile-friendly UI pass (CSS only): the page now flows and scrolls vertically on phones (using `100dvh`) instead of being locked to the viewport, the toolbar wraps, primary controls have larger touch targets, the channel table is a bounded internal scroll area, the actions popup stays on-screen, and a new 560px breakpoint single-columns the serial actions and full-widths the view toggle. Desktop layout is unchanged.
- Mobile channel table: instead of compressing all 17 columns to fit the screen (unreadable, overlapping headers), the table now keeps its natural width with no-wrap headers and readable, tappable cells, and scrolls horizontally. The Location column stays compact.
- Made the Serial Bridge controls a collapsible `<details>` on mobile (a static heading on desktop) so the channel list isn't pushed down. The mobile channel view stays the horizontally-scrolling table (a card view was tried and reverted by preference). Desktop layout is unchanged.
- Added an automatic dark theme. All colors were tokenized into CSS custom properties and a dark palette is applied via `prefers-color-scheme: dark`, so the UI (including the About page) follows the operating-system light/dark setting. No JS and no markup changes — light and dark share one code path; light appearance is unchanged.
