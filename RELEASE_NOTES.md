# Release Notes

## 2026-07-03
- Added a native Prolific PL2303-over-WebUSB driver, so PL2303 programming cables work on Android Chrome alongside FTDI. The driver detects the chip generation from the device descriptor (original 01, HX-era, TA/TB, and the newer HXN family: GC/GB/GT/GL/GE/GS) and applies the matching register map: legacy chips get the kernel-documented startup handshake and register purges, HXN chips skip the legacy startup and use their own reset/flow-control registers. DTR/RTS control lines are supported (required for radio cloning). Vendor requests follow the Linux kernel driver (vendor-type writes, bRequest 0x01 legacy / 0x80-0x81 HXN), fixing two request-type bugs present in the existing open-source WebUSB ports this work was checked against. Verified end-to-end on Android Chrome with a PL2303 cable and a real radio.

## 2026-07-02
- Added a DOM-free channel clipboard module (`web/js/clipboard.js`) with unit tests: spreadsheet-compatible TSV serialize/parse using the canonical CHIRP CSV header, header-or-positional row mapping for pasted text, and a pure move-by-one row reorder algorithm.
- Added channel copy/cut/paste, like desktop CHIRP: Ctrl/Cmd+C/X/V on selected rows plus Copy/Cut/Paste items in the channel actions menu. Copied channels are tab-separated text with the CHIRP CSV header, so they paste directly into Google Sheets/Excel, other webchirp tabs, and desktop CHIRP — and back. Paste overwrites downward from the first selected row (with a confirmation listing affected channels), extends the list past the end, and appends when nothing is selected; shortcuts stay out of the way while editing a cell or when text is selected.
- Added channel reordering: Move Up/Move Down toolbar buttons and Alt+ArrowUp/Alt+ArrowDown move the selected rows by one position (preserving relative order, clamping at the edges), with Location renumbering automatically.
- Fixed the FTDI-over-WebUSB read deadlock that broke all receives: the stream `pull()` resolved without enqueuing when a packet carried only the FTDI 2-byte status header (which an idle chip sends every latency tick), and per the Streams spec such a pull is never re-invoked — so reads wedged permanently after the first idle packet. `pull()` now keeps polling through status-only packets (and stalls) and resolves only after enqueuing real payload. This was the cause of the Android clone-handshake failure (no ACK; radio resets).
- Hardened FTDI-over-WebUSB initialization to match native drivers: `open()` now purges the RX/TX FIFOs after reset (stale bytes can no longer masquerade as protocol responses) and sets the latency timer to 4 ms (down from the 16 ms power-on default) for snappier byte-oriented reads.
- Fixed silent failure modes in the FTDI-over-WebUSB read path: a stalled bulk IN endpoint is now recovered with `clearHalt` and retried (previously it returned "stall" forever with no data and no error), babble results raise a real error, and the serial read loop logs why it ended instead of dying silently.
- Verified working end-to-end on Android Chrome with an FT231X cable: downloading a Baofeng UV-5R over WebUSB completes. Documented in the README that FTDI is currently the only chip family the WebUSB path is verified to work with.
- Fixed unreadable, overlapping channel-table headers on desktop: the table no longer compresses all 17 columns to fit the window (`table-layout: fixed`), instead taking its natural width with no-wrap headers and scrolling horizontally when the window is narrower — the same approach the mobile pass already used below 900px, now applied at all viewport sizes.

## 2026-06-23
- Radio make/model dropdowns now populate instantly from a prebuilt static catalog (`web/radio-catalog.json`) instead of booting Pyodide and importing every CHIRP driver on first load; live driver enumeration remains as a fallback.
- Added a `build:catalog` npm script (run automatically by `build:dist`) that regenerates the catalog from the local CHIRP submodule.
- Added a search box above the make/model dropdowns to filter radios by make or model.
- Mobile-friendly UI pass (CSS only): the page now flows and scrolls vertically on phones (using `100dvh`) instead of being locked to the viewport, the toolbar wraps, primary controls have larger touch targets, the channel table is a bounded internal scroll area, the actions popup stays on-screen, and a new 560px breakpoint single-columns the serial actions and full-widths the view toggle. Desktop layout is unchanged.
- Mobile channel table: instead of compressing all 17 columns to fit the screen (unreadable, overlapping headers), the table now keeps its natural width with no-wrap headers and readable, tappable cells, and scrolls horizontally. The Location column stays compact.
- Made the Serial Bridge controls a collapsible `<details>` on mobile (a static heading on desktop) so the channel list isn't pushed down. The mobile channel view stays the horizontally-scrolling table (a card view was tried and reverted by preference). Desktop layout is unchanged.
- Added an automatic dark theme. All colors were tokenized into CSS custom properties and a dark palette is applied via `prefers-color-scheme: dark`, so the UI (including the About page) follows the operating-system light/dark setting. No JS and no markup changes — light and dark share one code path; light appearance is unchanged.
- Added a WebUSB serial path so radios can be reached when native Web Serial is unavailable or cannot drive the adapter. A single device chooser dispatches the selected adapter to a chip-specific driver: a built-in FTDI-over-WebUSB driver for FTDI adapters (FT231X/FT232R, etc.), and Google's `web-serial-polyfill` for USB CDC-ACM devices. Other vendor-specific cables (CH340/CP2102/PL2303) are not supported over WebUSB.
- Added a "Connect via WebUSB" button that forces the WebUSB path. This is needed on Chrome for Android (Chrome 148+), which exposes `navigator.serial` but only supports a limited set of devices — not FTDI/PL2303-class chips — so auto-detection alone would always pick the unsupported native transport. The default "Connect" button still prefers native Web Serial.
