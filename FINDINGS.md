## CHIRP / Pyodide runtime

- **static-driver-catalog** (2026-06-23): `list_registered_radios()` in Pyodide imports all ~191 CHIRP drivers, each triggering a blocking jsDelivr fetch via `ChirpCdnFinder` — so the catalog is precomputed at build time (`scripts/build-catalog.mjs` → `web/radio-catalog.json`). The runtime accepts it only when its `chirpRevision` exactly matches `DEFAULT_CHIRP_REVISION` (`web/js/python-sources.mjs`), falling back to live enumeration otherwise; `build:catalog` refuses to emit on a drifted submodule. Pyodide boots lazily on first radio selection / CSV / serial action.
- **rpc-fifo-queue** (2026-06-23): the lazy import hook suspends the interpreter mid-import (JSPI `run_sync`), so two concurrent RPCs importing the same driver re-execute the module body → CHIRP raises `Duplicate radio driver id`; concurrent RPCs also clobber the shared `_sel_*` interpreter globals. All Pyodide-backed RPCs must go through the FIFO call queue (`web/js/call-queue.mjs`); only `getRuntimeInfo` bypasses it. UI-side loads carry monotonic tokens so stale responses never overwrite a newer selection.
- **settings-need-backing-state** (2026-03-14): many drivers only materialize settings from a cached clone image, parsed file image, or live session — `get_settings()` on blank/default state can throw (missing parsed memory, missing `_` translation bindings, `None` values; e.g. `baofeng_uv17Pro.UV17Pro`). Treat settings as unavailable until backing state exists. When instantiating for metadata enumeration, fall back to `radio_cls("")` if `radio_cls(None)` fails.
- **skip-immutable-on-apply** (2026-03-14): replaying serialized values onto a fresh settings tree includes immutable fields, which drivers reject with `This value is not mutable`; bridge-side apply logic must skip non-mutable CHIRP values entirely.
- **upstream-get-max-defect** (2026-03-14, still present 2026-07-23): vendored CHIRP's `RadioSettingValueFloat.get_max()` has no `return` (`chirp/chirp/settings.py:203`), so it returns `None`; serialize float bounds via the `_max` instance field fallback.

## Channel grid / CSV

- **csv-power-column-ignored** (2026-03-16): `chirp_common.Memory.really_from_csv()` ignores the `Power` column entirely, leaving `mem.power` unset so `set_memory()` falls back to index 0 (`High`). Direct channel writes must set power explicitly; confirmed on real UV-5R hardware (Low uploaded, read back High).
- **paste-readonly-columns** (2026-07-23): `normalizeValue()` returns `previous` for `editable: false` columns, so pasted rows silently kept defaults (e.g. TStep reset to `2.50` on UV-5R where `has_tuning_step=False`; same for `Comment`, ctone/dtcs/offset-gated columns). Programmatic row builders (paste, repeater/GMRS imports) pass `allowReadOnly` (`web/js/ui.js`) so kind/options validation applies but the editable gate doesn't; interactive editors keep the gate.
- **numeric-enum-matching** (2026-07-23): enum columns with numeric labels (`TStep` "5.00", `rToneFreq` "88.5", `DtcsCode` "023") must fall back to numeric-equality matching, since spreadsheets normalize values to "5", "12.5", "23".

## Radio images (.img) & metadata

- **img-detection-needs-import** (2026-07-23): `directory.get_radio_by_image()` only searches drivers already in `DRV_TO_RADIO`, and the browser imports drivers lazily — so `handleLoadImage` parses the metadata trailer first (`read_image_metadata_base64`, driver-free), resolves the module via the catalog (`findCatalogRadioForImageMetadata`: exact `rclass` class-name match, then vendor/model fallback), imports it, then runs detection.
- **rclass-may-be-unregistered** (2026-07-23): image metadata `rclass` can name a directory-unregistered class — `export_image_base64` from `uv5r.BaofengUV5R` stamps that name, but the registered entry is `BaofengUV5RGeneric`. Catalog matching must keep the vendor/model fallback, and must apply `directory.MODEL_COMPAT` remaps (e.g. Retevis RT-5R → RT5R) when reading metadata.

## Hosting & deployment

- **pages-cache-window** (2026-07-22): GitHub Pages serves everything with a fixed, non-configurable `Cache-Control: max-age=600` + ETag (Fastly). This creates a ≤10-minute post-deploy window where a stale `index.html` can 404 on old content-hashed asset names. Self-healing and low-impact; if it ever matters, make `build:dist` retain the previous generation of hashed assets rather than fighting headers. Heavy payloads (Pyodide, CHIRP sources) come from jsDelivr with long cache lifetimes, not Pages.
- **pages-workflow-deploy** (2026-07-22): Pages deploys via `.github/workflows/pages.yml` from `dist/`, HTTPS enforced at `https://webchirp.jasiek.me/` (Web Serial/WebUSB require a secure context; the previous legacy Jekyll build of raw `master` had neither).
- **no-crossorigin-embeds** (2026-03-14): `buttons.github.io/buttons.js` (and similar embed widgets) cannot work under COEP/COOP cross-origin isolation, even self-hosted — hence the custom `web/js/github-button.js`.

## GitHub PR gotchas

- **pr-refs-go-stale** (2026-07-22/23): GitHub pins a PR's `base.sha` to the merge-base at creation and never advances it (phantom already-merged files stay in the diff — PR #8), and the async PR-sync job can persistently fail to advance `headRefOid` after pushes (PR #7 — recurred on every push). Same workaround for both: retarget the base and back (`gh pr edit N --base <other>` then `--base master`), which re-records both refs. `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/master...<head>` always computes a fresh merge-base and is the reliable view of a PR's true diff. Diagnostic order: `git ls-remote` (push landed?) → compare API (GitHub sees commits?) → PR `headRefOid` (PR synced?).

## Process

- **merge-can-drop-tests** (2026-07-23): the `eaeba93` upstream merge took master's `package.json` wholesale, silently dropping two clipboard test scripts from `npm run test:channels`. "Take theirs" resolutions on `package.json` need a check that branch-added test entries survive.
