- `buttons.github.io/buttons.js` is not a viable GitHub star widget under cross-origin isolation. Even if the script is self-hosted, the widget path still depends on cross-origin embed resources, which conflicts with `COEP`/`COOP` on the static `codeplug.org` deployment.
- The bug-report CTA was previously hidden until debug logs matched `error|traceback|exception`, which made manual reports impossible for usability bugs or flows that fail without those exact markers. The report action should stay visible and prefill a generic issue even with no selected radio or captured runtime error.
- Some CHIRP drivers do not instantiate cleanly with `None` when enumerating metadata or settings from a non-downloaded state. Generic runtime helpers should fall back to `radio_cls("")` to preserve best-effort schema loading before a live download.
- Clone-mode settings introspection is not safe to assume on blank/default state. `get_radio_settings()` can fail for drivers like `baofeng_uv17Pro.UV17Pro` unless the runtime has first been seeded with a real cached image or download result.
- An all-radios initial-load sweep shows the browser prep path is broader than the `UV17Pro` failure: several drivers currently throw during `get_radio_settings()` on blank/default state, including missing parsed memory objects, missing `_` translation bindings, and serialization of `None` setting values.
- Root cause: browser startup was treating CHIRP radio settings as static metadata. In practice many drivers only materialize settings from loaded backing state: a cached clone image, a parsed file image, or a live serial session. Initial UI load should treat settings as unavailable until that backing state exists, instead of eagerly calling `get_settings()`.
- Radio-settings validation was replaying every serialized value onto a fresh CHIRP settings tree before upload, including immutable fields that the UI correctly disabled. Drivers can reject those no-op assignments with `This value is not mutable`, so bridge-side apply logic must skip non-mutable CHIRP values entirely.
- Vendored CHIRP's `RadioSettingValueFloat.get_max()` currently returns `None` because the method body has no `return`. Runtime code that serializes float setting bounds must tolerate that upstream defect and fall back to the instance `_max` field.
- `webchirp-hw-*` temp directories were created by older real-radio CLI test infrastructure in commit `1f820a5`, but that code was removed in `b456a75`. The remaining `.gitignore` entry was stale residue; current tracked code no longer creates repo-root hardware temp directories.

- Direct channel-to-codeplug writes in `web/python/runtime_bridge.py` normalized the CSV `Power` cell but still fed the row through `chirp_common.Memory.really_from_csv()`, which ignores the `Power` column entirely. On radios like `uv5r.BaofengUV5R`, that leaves `mem.power` unset and `set_memory()` falls back to index `0`, which is `High`; a live repro on `/dev/cu.usbserial-110` confirmed that changing channel 0 from `High` to `Low` uploaded successfully but read back as `High`.
- The runtime bridge already exposes enough generic primitives for an agent-facing hardware CLI without adding new Python APIs: `download_selected_radio()` returns rows/settings/CSV, `export_image_base64()` builds CHIRP `.img` payloads, and `load_image_base64()` plus `upload_selected_radio()` cover the corresponding write path.

- The left sidebar layout relies on flex shrinking. When vertical space gets tight, `.left-panel-main` shrinks before the experimental warning card, which can visually pull the warning upward into the radio selection area instead of letting lower content fall behind the bottom debug output section.
